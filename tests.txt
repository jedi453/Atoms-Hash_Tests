NOTES - FNV1A, Murmur2 and Murmur3 Seem to do well in general
      - SDBM, DJB2, DJB2A Do well for Strings, but some trivial contrieved examples Break them
        - E.g. Hashing "1" to "658476" and "000000" to "999999"
        - In cases where these hashes fail, Using a Prime Modulus/Number of Buckets
          Seems to Greatly Increase usefulness, but I'm not convinced this is always repeatable
      - In General, Modulus Prime Number seems to be Able to Smooth Over Some Rough Edges
        of Hash Functions Which Have Issues with Contrieved Examples
        - Not sure if there's a downside for Always Using this Technique/What it Would Be.
      - LOSELOSE ( i.e. Hash from K&R1 ) Fails no matter what... Don't Use it!
      - I Read that Murmur2 and Murmur3 were Broken, Careful with their use
        - Situations that require any security or peace of mind should probably
          just use a Cryptographic Hash Function,
          the Hash Functions Implemented Here may be too simple for their own good.
      - Theoretically, the closer to zero, the better for Standard Deviations Below,
        but Around 1 Seems to Indicate Success. 
        - Must Realize that Without Integer Avg Elements Per Bucket,
          Standard Deviation can't be 0, but can/should be less than about 1
      - Standard Deviation of Average vs Actual Elements Per Bucket
        Might not be a good/fair test, but with enough samples, I would think
        that Distribution should be as close to even as possible when the
        hash function does a good job of producing a good pseudo-random hash
        from its String
