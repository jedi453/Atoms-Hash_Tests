3.1)

  It looks like using a power of 2 buckets size vs. a slightly lower prime doesn't make much tangible difference
with the words in the dictionaries found here.

  FNV-1A and LOSE-LOSE were used here.  Standard Deviation of Bucket Lengths was taken,
the FNV-1A hash gave a standard deviation of about 1 on all tests,
the LOSE-LOSE algorithm gave a standard deviation of 19+ in all tests, clearly showing bias.

  I'm not completely sure what the ideal standard deviation should be,
but I would imagine it should be <= 1. Given a non-integer average atoms per bucket,
I would think that <1 would be hard to achieve even with a very good hash function,
as the distance between the average and the number of atoms per bucket would
always be >0, even if the hashing were perfect.

  This convinces me that FNV-1A is a good hash function in terms of distribution.
